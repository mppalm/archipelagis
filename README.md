This web map visualizes how demographic change will affect access to health care services across municipalities. By comparing the elderly population in 2024 with projected changes in 2045, users can identify regions where health care demand may exceed capacity and where service gaps or pressure areas are likely to emerge. The map supports evidence-based planning for resilient health systems by helping to locate underserved areas, visualize demographic pressure, and anticipate future mismatches between an aging population and health care capacity.
<br/>
<br/>
The map supports planners and policymakers in integrating demographic forecasts into long-term urban and health infrastructure strategies.
<br/>
<br/>
Two main layers enable comparison over time: <br/>
- 2024 Layer: Shows the current share of elderly people in each municipality - helping urban planners understand today’s spatial distribution of aging populations and existing health care access. <br/>
- 2045 Layer: Displays the percentage increase or decrease of elderly residents, highlighting future hotspots of demographic pressure and areas where demand for care services is expected to grow most.
<br/>
<br/>
Another dataset shows the location of health care services, divided into: <br/>
- Hospitals <br/>
- Municipal Health Centers <br/>
- Private Medical Services <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Together, these layers allow users to: <br/>
- Locate underserved areas or regions where population aging will likely outpace current health care capacity, <br/>
- Support planning for new facilities or service expansions, <br/>
- Prioritize mobility and infrastructure improvements for older adults, and <br/>
- Monitor spatial equity in access to health care across municipalities.
